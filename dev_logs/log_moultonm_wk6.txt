Dev Log 6: Week of Oct. 24, 2017

Activities:
- Redesigned chat functionality using Android's RecyclerView instead of ListView. This provides a much nicer interface with
  proper scrolling chat log
  
- Got Socket.io working with channels to segment chat messages into their own streams

- Created a chat room system, where users host rooms (stored on the server) and then subscribe to that room's unique chat stream

- Added a 'join room' interface, that asks the server for a listing of currently available chat rooms and nicely displays them
  for the user to pick from. Whichever room the user picks properly joins them to that room's chat stream
  
- Wrote up documentation for deliverable 2 and discussed demo plans with team

Time Taken: ~15 hrs
